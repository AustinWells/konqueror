Intro
=====
I am trying to create a picture of how Konqueror should look 
like in KDE 2.0. If such a picture is clear, it is easier to 
build Konqueror such that it will feel like a consistent piece 
of software. This is of course only my view of the things. If 
someone has other views please let this know. It will help if 
a sort of common idea about the future of Konqueror exists.

KDE 2.0
=======
I think we should keep Konqueror a "browser": You can browse 
with it, and look at things. But when you want to _DO_ things, 
you will need a full-fledged application.

So you can view HTML with it.
You can view directories with it.
You can view text-files with it (read-only). (basically kless)
You can view images with it.
You can view mail-folders with it.
You can view newsgroups with it.
You can view xxx....

When you want more advanced manipulating options, modify things, 
or create things (writing a mail for instance) the "Real (tm)" 
application should pop up with its own menubars etc.

There is of course a thin line between viewing and modifying. 
With the file browser you want to be able to move/rename/delete 
files. So if we allow this functionality for file-browsing, we 
should also allow it for mail-browsing or news-browsing. 
(e.g. move/delete message cq. postings).

Creating does not really belong in a browser (apart from 
directories) because you will almost always need an application 
for this anyway. I seldom go to a directory to select "create xyz". 
Most of the time you start an application to create "xyz" and 
when you are done, you think of a nice place to store it.
(I think Microsoft wants us to believe otherwise, with their 
"document-orientated" Windows95 marketing) 
((Well, sometimes you are browsing and have a sudden urge to put 
a text-file like README in a directory. But for that you still 
need a text-editor. Just creating an empty file is of little use.))

Why is this important?
======================
There must be a clear distinction between what can be done with
Konqueror and what can be done with the application self. If there 
is no distinction we don't need Konqueror. 

Smooth integration
==================
With this Konqueror thing we have to tell the user a thing or 
two. We have to tell the user what he/she is doing: 
"Viewing a text-file", "Viewing a web-page", "Viewing a FTP-site", 
"Viewing e-mail". Because the options available to the user, depend 
on what he is doing: You can reply to e-mail. But you can't reply 
to a FTP-site. You can sort the entries of a FTP directory, but
you can't sort a web-page.

At the same time, we have to tell the user that he/she is "Viewing". 
If you want to edit the web-page, the web-editor comes up. If you 
want to reply to the e-mail, the mail-composer comes up. At that 
time the user is editing/changing/modyfying.

From the users point of view, the "viewing" part is konqueror. The
editing part is the application.

From the developers point of view, this can be different. The view
e-mail mode of Konqueror could (but it doesn't have to) be handled 
by the same instance of kmail as the "edit" mode of kmail. If this 
will be indeed the case should depend on programming considerations. 

What should not depend on programming considerations, is how it is
presented to the user.

I'm serious about integrating mail-viewing in Konqueror. 
(From a user point of view).

I think it is a very bad idea to put mail-reading code in 
Konqueror. (From a developers point of view).

Konqueror should be able to display mail/mailboxes by embedding 
a mail-viewer. This mail-viewer should (in the case of a mail-viewer) 
be a seperate application from a developers point of view, but should
integrate seemless with Konqueror from the user point of view. This 
application can be kmail, a light version of kmail, or any other 
application that can display mails and supports this embedded KFM-view 
idea.

For viewing HTML or GIF files, Konqueror will most likely implement
the functionality itself. For the user it should not make any difference
if a view is implemented in Konqueror itself or in a seperate 
application.

The technology to embed the mail-viewer should be something CORBA based.
Most likely KOM/Openparts.

Konqueror should not become a program like Netscape Communicator:
A program that tries to do everything itself, and as result, does
everything very poorly.

Konqueror should do it better and the Unix way: Have speciliazed
components which are very good in their task. Konqueror provides 
the seemless integration of them and provides easy navigation 
abilities.
