- When word wrap is false, Reggie suggested adding a tooltip with the fullname

- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL.

- Sorting by date, ...

- Fix dropping an icon on itself (Reggie says "Konqy's Iconviewitem
has to check in acceptDrop if the drop which should be
accepted (the QMimeSource you get in this method) is the same
as the item itself by decoding it and comparing the files they point to,
and refuse or accept the drop according to this result.")

- Add support (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files, like :
...
Actions=Eject
[Desktop Action Eject]
Name=Eject
Name[fr]=Ejecter
Exec=eject /mnt/cdrom #
(Works fine BTW, we just need the GUI for it !)
Hmm, that last line is a hack (the url is appended).
In fact we miss %D or something like that, in the desktop entry
standard, for "the device in the Type=FSDevice .desktop file"...

- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- open-with dlg : browse button [and save as applnk if checkbox "remember"]

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).  => KRun

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- Image Preview : make size configurable for tackat :)

- HTMLView (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)
