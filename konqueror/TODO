- I think kdesktop and konqueror should share more code (the QIconView-inherited class)

  (Simon) What about kdesktop loading/linking libkonqiconview :-)
  (David) libkonqiconview is konqueror specific, but let's move KonqIconViewWidget to libkonq.

- Make wordwrap in iconview configurable and add a tooltip with the fullname when wordwrap off

- Handle MMB on icon (New View)

- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL.

- Sorting by date, ...

- A confirmation box before deleting would contain the list of files to be 
  deleted, if few of them otherwise the number (or simply "...")

- drop events on an icon / URL should be handled in a central place.
  + take code from kfm, for special cases (trash, ....)

- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.

- Thumbnails (using the xview code in kimgio ; making image size configurable)
  Needs the port to QIconView first.

- More key bindings. Lots of things are missing key bindings,
  Ctrl+A for select all for instance. => partially done.
  Needs disconnecting/reconnecting on view switching.

- Configurable toplevel items in the treeview

- see grep TODO *.cc *.h
