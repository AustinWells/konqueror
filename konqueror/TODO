(from kfm)
- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL.
- Sorting by date, ... 

- (Following to discussion with Sven) : Update kpropsdlg so that it can show
up with a default mimetype / application / .... It would _know_ the
filename but would only use it to write, not read at startup.
This involves making New/Mimetype and New/Application built-in
templates, just like New/Folder, since the file would be not used at all.

- The ability to edit the binding for a mime type by
  selecting a file of that type.

- drop events on an icon / URL should be handled in a central place
  (e.g. konq_kfmviewitem). In any case it should be moved out
  of kiconcontainer !!
  + take code from kfm, for special cases (trash, ....)

- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

- select files using shell globs.

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).

- When you are adding to the selction (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.

- More key bindings. Lots of things are missing key bindings,
  Ctrl+A for select all for instance. => partially done.
  Needs disconnecting/reconnecting on view switching.

- Configurable toplevel items in the treeview
