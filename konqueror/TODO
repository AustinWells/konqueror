kio:
====
- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL. (i.e. autodetect when passwd needed)

kio_http:
=========
- lacking errorPage stuff
- cache expiration (I think of the "non implemented" line-edit in kcontrol)
- and of course better SSL security as Waldo discovered  #3443

khtml:
======
- (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)
- meta-equiv redirections not supported #3051
- many bugs in the buglist :(

libkonq:
========

- Dialog box for choosing bookmark name :
   ( ) [ <Title> ]   (editable)
   ( ) [ <URL> ]     (editable)
 and option in kcmkonqhtml for showing this dialog (on by default ?)

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- #3350 when moving a file to a directory the box with copy/move/link pops up
even in this box the cursor icon is "forbidden" (_sometimes_). And add Cancel.

- Image Preview : make size configurable for tackat :)

konqueror framework:
====================

- Remove highlighted text color and text color from kcmkonq, and settings.

- Do we want "[X] Use directory properties" ?

- Action for enabling/disabling javascript, in Settings.

- the 'shared lib' or interface problem for plugins.

- What about a "clear" button at the right of the location bar, to clear the URL
before pasting another one ?

- Bug #2760 and other problems with splitter sizes

- #3176 : From the main KDE menu, choose "Context Help", next click on the main form of konqueror
(David): didn't get what that one was about...

- Duplicate window -> should duplicate history too.

- Renaming a profile

iconview:
========

- When word wrap is false, Reggie suggested adding a tooltip with the fullname

- Stop not possible while image preview running - to be tested. #2872


iconview+listviews:
===================

- Sorting by extension ?

- Hide backup files (files ending in ~ or #) - see #3212

- if we keep "background color for this directory" should we have "text color for
this directory" too... ?

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- Undo functionality

- Link symbol (see post "Links" on kfm-devel)


listviews:
==========

- textview: dragging from there and dropping in another view crashes, I'm told.

- crash in double-click mode when double-clicking. #3356 (already fixed?)

dirtree:
========

- KDirWatch on subdirs of the configuration dir

kpropsdlg (kfile):
======
- Bug #2717: turning off all read permissions

- Maybe add GUI (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files (example: see eject action in the CDROM template) ?
- Maybe a checkbox for the appstart-notification thing ?

And more:
=========

- Show caitoo in the RMB on links - this is different from usual services,
since it's not associated to a mimetype, but to non-local protocols...

- see grep TODO *.cc *.h

- see http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkfm.html and http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkonqueror.html
