- When word wrap is false, Reggie suggested adding a tooltip with the fullname

- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL.

- Sorting by date, ...

- A nicer confirmation box before deleting would contain the list of files to be 
  deleted, if few of them otherwise the number (or simply "...")

- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).  => KRun

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- Image Preview : make size configurable for tackat :)

- Integrate kdf and kdu ...

- More key bindings. Lots of things are missing key bindings,
  Ctrl+A for select all for instance. => partially done.
  Needs disconnecting/reconnecting on view switching.

- Configurable toplevel items in the treeview (GUI for konq_dirtree)

- see grep TODO *.cc *.h
