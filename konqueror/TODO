(from kfm)
- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  use name in a URL.
- Sorting by date, ... 

- (Following to discussion with Sven) : Update kpropsdlg so that it can show
up with a default mimetype / application / .... It would _know_ the
filename but would only use it to write, not read at startup.
This involves making New/Mimetype and New/Application built-in
templates, just like New/Folder, since the file would be not used at all.

- drop events on an icon / URL should be handled in a central place
  (e.g. konq_kfmviewitem). In any case it should be moved out
  of kiconcontainer !!
  + take code from kfm, for special cases (trash, ....)
