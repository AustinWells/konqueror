kio:
====
- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL. (i.e. autodetect when passwd needed)
- Implement KIO::link as a job

kio_http:
=========
- lacking errorPage stuff
- cache expiration (I think of the "non implemented" line-edit in kcontrol)
- and of course better SSL security as Waldo discovered  #3443

khtml:
======
- (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)
- meta-equiv redirections not supported #3051
- many bugs in the buglist :(
- #3490, stop animated gifs

libkonq:
========

- Dialog box for choosing bookmark name :
   ( ) [ <Title> ]   (editable)
   ( ) [ <URL> ]     (editable)
 and option in kcmkonqhtml for showing this dialog (on by default ?)

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- #3350 when moving a file to a directory the box with copy/move/link pops up
even in this box the cursor icon is "forbidden" (_sometimes_). And add Cancel.

- delete file : if image, remove from .xvpics and .mospics/*/

- ordering templates: I'll wait for a kicker solution (.directory, .order...)
  and borrow it. This is not called stealing, it's called consistency :)

konqueror framework:
====================

- Remove highlighted text color and text color from kcmkonq, and settings.

- Do we want "[X] Use directory properties" ?

- Action for enabling/disabling javascript, in Settings.

- the 'shared lib' or interface problem for plugins.

- Bug #2760 and other problems with splitter sizes

- #3176 : From the main KDE menu, choose "Context Help", next click on the main form of konqueror
(David): didn't get what that one was about...

- Duplicate window -> should duplicate history too.

- Minicli's current directory (Dawit's last post on kde-cvs was confused I think.
  All we need is chdir() so that apps can find files from the current dir).

iconview+listviews:
===================

- Hide backup files (files ending in ~ or #) - see #3212

- if we keep "background color for this directory" should we have "text color for
this directory" too... ?

- Link symbol (see post "Links" on kfm-devel)


listviews:
==========

- textview: dragging from there and dropping in another view crashes, I'm told.

- grep for TODO in the .rc files: missing sorting options: dir firsts, case [in]sensitive

dirtree:
========

- Create dynamic items when browing non-local URLs (FTP etc.)

kpropsdlg (kfile):
======
- Bug #2717: turning off all read permissions

- Maybe add GUI (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files (example: see eject action in the CDROM template) ?
- Maybe a checkbox for the appstart-notification thing ?

kdesktop:
=========

- Different icons on different desktops (a bit late for this new feature, but
  the scheme for it is ready)

- Dropping an image could offer "set as background pixmap" in the popup

And more:
=========

- Show caitoo in the RMB on links - this is different from usual services,
since it's not associated to a mimetype, but to non-local protocols...

- Embedding kspread in konq, and pressing reload creates a new page  ?!?!?!?

- Action for clearing the location bar (for shortcut)


- see grep TODO *.cc *.h

- see http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkfm.html and http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkonqueror.html
