kpropsdlg (kfile):
======
- Bug #2717: turning off all read permissions

- Add support (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files, like :
...
Actions=Eject
[Desktop Action Eject]
Name=Eject
Name[fr]=Ejecter
Exec=eject /mnt/cdrom #
(Works fine BTW, we just need the GUI for it !)
Hmm, that last line is a hack (the url is appended).
In fact we miss %D or something like that, in the desktop entry
standard, for "the device in the Type=FSDevice .desktop file"...

kio:
====
- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL. (i.e. autodetect when passwd needed)
- About mounting : handle warnings differently than errors.
(After a message on stderr, test if mounted, and if yes -> it was just a
warning.)

khtml:
======
- (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)
- many bugs :(
- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

libkonq:
========

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- #3350 when moving a file to a directory the box with copy/move/link pops up
even in this box the cursor icon is "forbidden" (_sometimes_). And add Cancel.

- Add folder in bookmark (new menu item on top of each bookmark menu)  #3349

- Image Preview : make size configurable for tackat :)

konqueror framework:
====================

- What about a "clear" button at the right of the location bar, to clear the URL
before pasting another one ?

- Open Location has unknown icon (KURLRequesterDlg bug probably)

- Bug #2760 and other problems with splitter sizes

- #3176 : From the main KDE menu, choose "Context Help", next click on the main form of konqueror


iconview:
========

- When word wrap is false, Reggie suggested adding a tooltip with the fullname

- Stop not possible while image preview running - to be tested. #2872


iconview+listviews:
===================

- Sorting by date, by extension...
Many bugs (#3220 #2871...)

- Hide backup files (files ending in ~ or #) - see #3212

- if we keep "background color for this directory" should we have "text color for
this directory" too... ?

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).  => KRun

- Undo functionality

- Link symbol (see post "Links" on kfm-devel)


listviews:
==========

- textview: dragging from there and dropping in another view crashes, I'm told.

- honour icon size (#3092)

- crash in double-click mode when double-clicking. #3356

dirtree:
========

- clicking on an item emits an openURLRequest, which calls back openURL,
which does a followURL, which (used to) open the dir. Huh. #3472
But opening the dir on followURL is necessary to follow navigation :(
Solution ? Maybe look into current dir to find item to open to follow
navigation ? Or make the difference between openURL calls ? Huh.


And more:
=========

- Integrate kdf and kdu ... (#3111) or rather use KIO::listRecursive for du.

- see grep TODO *.cc *.h

- see http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkfm.html and http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkonqueror.html
