- When word wrap is false, Reggie suggested adding a tooltip with the fullname

- Nice ftp dialog for users who do not know how to put their
  user name in a URL.

- Sorting by date, ...

- Add support (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files, like :
...
Actions=Eject
[Desktop Action Eject]
Name=Eject
Name[fr]=Ejecter
Exec=eject /mnt/cdrom #
(Works fine BTW, we just need the GUI for it !)
Hmm, that last line is a hack (the url is appended).
In fact we miss %D or something like that, in the desktop entry
standard, for "the device in the Type=FSDevice .desktop file"...

- About mounting : handle warnings differently than errors.
(After a message on stderr, test if mounted, and if yes -> it was just a
warning.)

- implement search functionality in KonqHTMLView -> wait until khtml catched
  up :-)

- select files to be shown using shell globs (file:/home/dfaure/*.txt)

- open-with dlg : browse button [and save as applnk if checkbox "remember"]

- Better handling of multiple selections (eg. try selecting
  several images then invoking kview - you get loads of kview 
  processes rather than just one).  => KRun

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- Image Preview : make size configurable for tackat :)

- Tree view: sorting, fixing columns, ...
In konqueror.rc, add treeview config.

[TreeView_default]
Columns = Column Name, Column Name, ...
 (i18n'ed in konqueror -> full list there using i18n_noop)
UDSEntries = UDSEntry constant (KIO::UDS_...), ...

Some protocols have additionnal fields -> dialog box for
showing the other fields (list of available fields comes
from the .desktop entry of the protocol).

Saving layout for the other protocols :
[TreeView_gopher]
...

In konqueror/treeview: for the current protocol, create in memory
the dicts    UDS number -> column number (reversing the config file)
                  This allows sorting the UDSEntryList in one go.

  + QStringList of headers (i18n'ed).

- Another config thingy: moving the user-paths (mv + updating konquerorrc)
or should we detect moving of the actual folders themselves ? Gee that
would rock no ?

- HTMLView (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)

- Integrate kdf and kdu ...

- Add URL support to KDirWatch (faked of course, manually signalled,
  but so that doing anything over FTP refreshes the view)...

- More key bindings

- Undo functionality
