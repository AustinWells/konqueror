2000-11-15  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Implemented auto-saving of toolbars (KMainWindow),
	removed "Save Settings".
	Fixed "clicking on directory in dirtree uses wrong view mode for dirs".

2000-11-06  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_operations.cc: statURL, calls a slot when it stat'ed
	the url and created a kfileitem for it.
	Used in doDrop when the destination's kfileitem is unknown. Fixes #14739.
	Also, KPropsDlg now does a similar thing when called with a KURL.

2000-11-05  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konqueror.rc: Moved the "open with" actions to the Location menu,
	and added a separator to the action list.

	* konq_view.cc (connectPart): moved call to setSaveViewPropertiesLocally
	(used to be in various places in KonqMW) so that the flag is
	also correct when switching views.

	* konq_dirpart.cc and directory views: apply background color and pixmap
	to the viewport(), and updated konq_iconview to do the same. This fixes
	many inconsistencies, and makes resizing a window much faster & smoother.
	Note that it has to be the viewport and not the widget, otherwise in the
	listview, the box between the scrollbars appears colored/pixmap-ed.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: action renamed View Properties Saved In Directory

2000-11-04  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc: now takes care of enableAllActions.
	Show led and active statusbar even in the tree+icon configuration
	(the rule is now "more than one view", not "more than one activeable 
	view"). This should remove some confusion.

	* konq_frame.cc: "Remove View" in RMB on statusbar.
	Don't try to activate passive views when clicking statusbar.
	Different background color on statusbar for active view.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Fixes for "Remove Active View" enabling,
	to avoid ending up with a lonely embedded konsole, and some
	cleanup of code for enabling other view-related actions.
	Introducing updateViewActions for common code between enableAllActions
	and slotPartActivated. Fixes a few glitches in action activation.

2000-10-31  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* libkonq: Implemented "Text preview" functionality

2000-10-26  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* keditbookmarks/*: Finally, a bookmark editor for konqueror.
	
	* kbookmarkmanager.*: Separated from kbookmark.* after dcopidl dying on
	"mutable" :). Implemented DCOP notifications between processes.
	Implemented "internal bookmark address". KonqBookmarkManager is no more.

	* kbookmarkbar.*: Update for XML bookmarks, fill in aboutToShow, update
	sub-menus upon changed() signal, enabled "Add Bookmark" and "New Folder"

2000-10-24  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kbookmark*: Reimplemented the bookmarks, they are now saved in XML.
	Desktop files are imported if the XML file doesn't exist (it's
	immediately saved, so this should happen only once).

2000-10-22  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_view.{cc,h} : changed part->child( 0, "KParts::BE" ) calls to
	  use the new childObject method in BrowserExtension

2000-10-22  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* dirtree/konq_dirtree.cc: Fixed support for devices in the directory 
	tree. It currently requires MountPoint in the device desktop file.

	* listview/konq_textviewwidget.cc: Only the Name column is now
	selected, and used as a drop area - like in other listviews.
	This requires the fix in KListView to work properly.

2000-10-21  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Fix for linked views saved in profile, introducing isLoadingProfile().

2000-10-20  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_misc.cc: Use webbrowsing profile for *.html *.htm as well.

2000-10-20  Simon Hausmann  <hausmann@kde.org>

	* Duplicate window duplicates the history as well.

1999-02-28  Simon Hausmann <tronical@gmx.net>

1999-02-09  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Source imported in kdebase/konqueror

1999-01-25  Torben Weis  <weis@kde.org>
