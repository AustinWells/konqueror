The searcher URI has now been completely removed from compilation and replaced
by the KURIFilter plugin directly in konqy's mainview code.  The searcher plugin
is left here, i.e. not completely removed in its entirty, for the very reason
mentioned by Yves below.

In February 2000,  konq_searcher's functionality was moved into a plugin for
the KURIFilter class. Since konq_searcher is the only Konq plugin, though,
I kept it as an example. It does use KURIFilter now, of course...
