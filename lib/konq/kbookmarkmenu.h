 * Rather, just use something like:
 *
 * <CODE>
 * bookmarks = new KBookmarkMenu(new KBookmarkOwner(), ...)
 * </CODE>
 *
 * If you wish to use your own editor or allow the user to add
 * bookmarks, you must overload this class.

 * This class provides a bookmark menu.  It is typically used in
 * cooperation with KActionMenu but doesn't have to be.
 *
 * If you use this class by itself, then it will use KDE defaults for
 * everything -- the bookmark path, bookmark editor, bookmark launcher..
 * everything.  These defaults reside in the classes
 * @ref KBookmarkOwner (editing bookmarks) and @ref KBookmarkManager
 * (almost everything else).  If you wish to change the defaults in
 * any way, you must reimplement and instantiate those classes
 * <em>before</em> this class is ever called.
 *
 * Using this class if very simple:
 * 
 * 1) Create a popup menu (either KActionMenu or QPopupMenu will do)
 * 2) Instantiate a new KBookmarkMenu object using the above popup
 *    menu as a parameter
 * 3) Insert your (now full) popup menu wherever you wish
 *
 * Again, if you wish to modify any defaults, the procedure has:
 *
 * 1a) Reimplement your own KBookmarkOwner
 * 1b) Reimplement and instantiate your own KBookmarkManager
