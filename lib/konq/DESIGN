libkonq is the construction kit for a file manager 
(together with libkio, which is at a lower level)

It is used by konqueror, of course, but also by kdesktop, which is 
another file manager in fact, and by apps that want to use
the properties dialog boxes (like kpanel and kfind) or the bookmark
classes.

libkonq contents :
==================

1) menus
kbookmark.*     : general purpose bookmark class
kbookmarkmenu.* : bookmark menu
konqpopupmenu.* : popupmenu for URLs
knewmenu.*      : implements the 'new' menu (file templates)

2) files
kfileitem.*     : item representing a file and all the information associated
kdirlister.*    : directory lister (handles kiojob and the kfileitems for you)

3) icons
kfileivi.*      : icon representing a file (inherits QListViewItem and 
                  uses KFileItem for holding file information)

4) dialog boxes
kpropsdlg.*     : the properties dialog box (for any URL)

5) configuration
konqsettings.*  : settings
konqdefaults.h  : default values, shared with kcmkonq
