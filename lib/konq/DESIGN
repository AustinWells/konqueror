libkonq is the construction kit for a file manager 
(together with libkio, which is at a lower level)

It is used by konqueror, of course, but also by kdesktop, which is 
another file manager in fact, and by apps that want to use
the properties dialog boxes (like kpanel and kfind) or the bookmark
classes (none yet... kohtml ? Hum, the bookmark classes would have to be moved
to kdelibs)

libkonq contents :
==================

1) menus
kbookmark.*     : general purpose bookmark class
kbookmarkmenu.* : openparts-based bookmark menu
kpopupmenu.*    : popupmenu for URLs
knewmenu.*      : implements the 'new' menu (file templates)

2) files
kfileitem.*     : item representing a file and all the information associated
kdirlister.*    : directory lister (handles kiojob and the kfileitems for you)

3) icons
kfileivi.*      : icon representing a file (inherits QListViewItem and 
                  uses KFileItem for holding file information)
kicondrag.*     : used together with kiconcontainer to move icons with the mouse
                  ( ... to be ported ... )

4) dialog boxes
kpropsdlg.*     : the properties dialog box (for any URL)
