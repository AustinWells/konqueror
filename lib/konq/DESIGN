libkonq is the construction kit for a file manager 
(together with libkio, which is at a lower level)

It is used by konqueror, of course, but also by kdesktop, which is 
another file manager in fact, and by apps that want to use
the properties dialog boxes (like kpanel and kfind) or the bookmark
classes.
